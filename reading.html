                    <h2>A Handmade Web</h2>
                    <h4>Q1: What is the thesis of this article?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Mez Breeze Carpenter's article explores how the "handmade web" reflects a historical and current
                        kind of resistance against the internet's commercialization and standardization. It honors the
                        early web's originality, innovation, and individualism and encourages active participation in
                        the development and policies of online pages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the mid to late 1990s, the web was an experiment for amateurs, artists, and creators to
                        express their creativity. These bright, rich, personal, and "under construction" web pages, are
                        like physical handmade print materials that allow users to reach back in time. besides, it gives
                        users access to source code, providing them with an opportunity to engage with the code and
                        blurring the lines between users and writers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, enterprise networks dominated by multinational corporations and proprietary platforms
                        have destroyed the "original spirit" of the web. Therefore, Mez Breeze Carpenter believes that
                        in a commercial environment, the "handmade web" is a form of slow and tiny resistance to
                        counter. it keeps the spirit of the early web, that the internet was full of limitless
                        possibilities, but encourages us to reconsider our relationship with the digital domain, calling
                        for more intimate and individualized encounters outside the limits of conventional commercial
                        platforms.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Q2: Carpenter describes the handmade web as a form of resistance. In your own words, what is
                        being resisted?</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are several elements or developments mentioned by the author in this article, that in the
                        digital landscape are being resisted or challenged, such as Commercialization and
                        Standardization of the Web - where the article resists the trend towards a highly commercialized
                        and standardized web environment dominated by multinational corporations, proprietary
                        applications, and content management systems, Homogenization - emphasizing the importance of
                        diverse and experimental web art and writing projects, Loss of Personal Identity - resists the
                        idea that individuals have lost control over their online identities due to the dominance of big
                        social media platforms and commercial websites, Proprietary Technologies - resisting the
                        prevalence of proprietary technologies that limit users' ability to understand and manipulate
                        the web, and etc. In summary, the resistance in this article is primarily directed towards the
                        commercialization, standardization, loss of personal identity, and proprietary nature of the
                        modern web.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Q3: Reflecting on your own experiences, what are other examples of drawing attention the
                        "physicality" of the web?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Reflecting on my own experience with “physicality” website that drew my attention would be
                        “Patatap” https://patatap.com/Links to an external site.. Back when I was little, I was super
                        interested in a “launch pad”, basically a coded machine that stores and plays multiple sound
                        effects, musical instruments, and songs with each button when it gets pressed. Unfortunately,
                        the launch pad’s price was a little big for me at that age, but I still had to fulfill my
                        satisfaction and found Patatap.com, a fully programmed website, eventually found out that it is
                        downloadable on mobile as well for both IOS and Android. I love this website because it wasn’t
                        as boring as any other launch pad simulator kind of stuff where we have very limited sounds and
                        buttons to press, but this Patatap.com provides MANY different sounds in A-Z keyboard bines with
                        6 different genres or modes that carry all different sound. Also, it was more enjoyable because
                        there is a mix of aural and visual senses that happens whenever buttons get pressed at the same
                        time playing the sound out of your device. I would say this is a fun-coded website and it’s
                        great for those people who are interested in remixing, music, or just to crash times when you
                        are bored.

                    <h2>What Screens Want</h2>
                    <h4>Q1: What is the thesis of this article?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Frank Chimero's article "What Screens Want," revolves around the distinctive nature of screens,
                        especially digital screens, and their inherent potential for transformation. screens should not
                        be merely static surfaces for displaying information; instead, they should be regarded as
                        interactive materials for designing interfaces. he emphasizes the significance of comprehending
                        the "grain" of screens, which is their fundamental capacity for change and movement. designers
                        should harness this dynamic quality effectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By giving examples of the debate "whether flat design and skeuomorphism are better",
                        highlighting the aesthetic neutrality of the screen as a carrier. In addition, he also explained
                        that Movement, change, and animation are not just beautiful, but should be used as a function to
                        help users refine information by giving examples of the three levels of flux: low, high, and
                        medium. The design community needs some precise terminology to help stakeholders communicate and
                        understand interface design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, he also mentioned the extensibility, openness, and community features of technology,
                        the internet, and commercial interests, encouraging designers to pay attention to and design
                        more impactful and meaningful digital interfaces.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Q2: Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? </h4>
                    <p>
                        The choice between skeuomorphic and flat design depends on the specific medium in question.
                        Traditional screens like those on mobile phones and web pages have transitioned from
                        skeuomorphism to flat design over time. Flat design is characterized by minimalism, cleanliness,
                        and consistency, which works well for these platforms. However, in emerging interfaces like AR,
                        VR, and smart home appliances, there's a greater emphasis on familiarity. Skeuomorphic design
                        plays a crucial role in helping users understand and interact with these interfaces by
                        simulating real-world elements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although today is an era where flat design is prevalent, I always believe that all “trend”or
                        “style” are cyclical. Just like fashion and typography, design trends undergo cycles where
                        once-abandoned styles eventually regain popularity when people tire of the prevailing aesthetic.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Q3: What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another
                        example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        It was an early animation device invented by Eadweard Muybridge in the late 19th century. It is
                        used to create the illusion of motion by displaying a series of still images in rapid
                        succession. The present invention emphasizes the concept of conveying movement and change
                        through a series of discrete frames or images.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In digital design, animations, transitions, and interactive elements are essential to guide
                        users into a dynamic and engaging experience. Designers use these techniques to provide
                        feedback, enhance user understanding, and create visually appealing interfaces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another example of film production that inspires digital design is the concept of
                        "storyboarding." In filmmaking, storyboards are used to visually plan and outline the sequence
                        of shots and scenes. This technique has been adopted in UX design as a method of planning and
                        visualizing user interactions and interface layout. Designers create wireframes or sketches to
                        outline a user's journey through a digital product or website.

                    <h2>Interface and Interpretation</h2>
                    <h4>Q1: How does Drucker define the term "interface"? How about the process of designing interfaces?
                        What is her opinion of interface design processes as they are generally handled today?</h4>
                    <p>
                        According to Johanna Drucker, an interface is a structure that mediates interactions and duties
                        between human users and complicated protocols in digital systems. Users interact with the system
                        there, and the system replies through its processes in this area. Drucker emphasizes that the
                        interface actively influences user behaviors and activities rather than being a passive
                        instrument.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Her criticisms of modern interface design methodologies highlight their mechanical and
                        task-oriented nature, placing an emphasis on effectiveness and user happiness while ignoring the
                        user's dynamic role in meaning construction. She contends that these systems do not take
                        humanistic viewpoints, cultural knowledge, or preferences into account. She advocates for a more
                        constructivist, subject-oriented strategy that acknowledges users' active involvement in
                        interface interactions. This method moves away from one-size-fits-all solutions and takes into
                        account the wide range of user behaviors and contextual complications in order to produce more
                        meaningful and culturally aware digital experiences.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Q2: What is Drucker's notion of "Humanistic Design"?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Design must emphasize the human experience, cultural context, and interpretive interaction over
                        solely utilitarian or technological factors. Interfaces are emphasized as dynamic environments
                        for inquiry, interpretation, and cultural reflection in humanistic design. It urges interfaces
                        to be more than merely useful tools; they should encourage critical thought, welcome ambiguity,
                        and honor the diversity of human expression. Drucker is an advocate of interfaces that offer
                        chances for deep involvement, critical thought, and a variety of viewpoints while also
                        reflecting the complexity of human thought and culture. This method pushes designers to go
                        beyond efficiency and utility to build interfaces that inspire, challenge, and enhance the lives
                        of users. It encourages designers to think about the ethical, cultural, and human components of
                        their work. Instead of only being a source of information, humanistic design aims to make
                        technology a vehicle for the expression of the human spirit.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Q3: As a process, what factors do you feel are central to the design of interfaces that are
                        missing from this article?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, it doesn't discuss how aesthetics and visual design play a role in the user experience,
                        which has a big impact. Aesthetics, such as color schemes, fonts, and overall visual appeal, are
                        crucial for capturing users' attention and efficiently delivering information. Second,
                        responsiveness is crucial for current interfaces in the era of varied devices. The need to make
                        sure interfaces adapt naturally to different screen sizes and resolutions is disregarded in the
                        text. For the best user experiences, distinct layout and design considerations are needed for
                        desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Finally, inclusivity and accessibility In many places, it
                        is not only the law but also morally required that interfaces be made usable by people with
                        impairments. To make interfaces accessible to everyone, regardless of their ability, elements
                        like screen reader compatibility, text replacements for graphics, and keyboard navigation must
                        be included.

                    <h2>Database as Symbolic Form</h2>
                    <h4>Q1: How does Manovich see the opposition between database and narrative? Manovich talks about
                        computer games as a form of Interactive Narrative. Can you speculate on other forms of
                        interactive narratives (in our culture or imagined) that aren't computer games?</h4>
                    <p>
                        According to Manovich, a key component of modern media and cultural expression is the conflict
                        between the database and the narrative. He recognizes that databases, which provide structured
                        information organization and retrieval, play a fundamental role in contemporary storage mediums.
                        On the other hand, narrative is ingrained in human society and satisfies our desire for
                        meaningful, cogent stories. Manovich suggests investigating their synergy to create novel
                        narrative forms rather than trying to eliminate this opposition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The emergence of AR and VR technology has enabled users to explore historical events and
                        cultural phenomena in a non-linear manner, providing them with access to extensive databases of
                        data and firsthand narratives. Virtual reality experiences, immersive storytelling
                        installations, and interactive museum displays enable audiences to interact with stories in
                        unique and engaging ways. These interactive narrative formats show how technology may improve
                        storytelling in a variety of ways, going beyond the realm of computer games.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Q2: Database as Symbolic Form was written 19 years ago now. What has changed? What hasn't
                        changed? Did Manovich's predictions come true?</h4>
                    <p>
                        In contemporary culture, databases are becoming more and more important. The relationship
                        between narratives and databases continues to influence how new media and cultural products are
                        produced.

                    <p>
                        Social media sites like Facebook and Instagram have become so popular that they have grown
                        enormous user bases and changed how people communicate and share their lives. Databases and user
                        experience are becoming even more integrated with streaming services like Spotify and TikTok,
                        which can now offer tailored suggestions based on user data.

                    <p>
                        While the technological landscape and the cultural applications of databases have broadened,
                        Manovich's findings regarding the friction between the database and story and the preservation
                        of certain aspects of culture remain pertinent.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Q3: Can you draw a connection between Manovich's ideas and your plan for your final project?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The final project takes the form of an interactive website that seamlessly integrates multiple
                        assignments from the course and is directly aligned with Lev Manovich's theory of databases and
                        narrative. The index is a dynamic database that shrewdly assembles various kinds of content.
                        Combine various assignments into three distinct sections: readings, projects, and exercises.
                        Users can freely browse all content on the website in a non-linear fashion using a variety of
                        imaginative and interactive forms. The Index is more of an interactive platform than a typical
                        portfolio, encouraging exploration of all content in the class.

                            individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Laurel Schwulst prefers people to have their own websites instead of relying on social
                            media. She thinks it's important because it gives individuals control, privacy, and the
                            ability to express themselves freely. In a time where a few big companies control social
                            media, having personal websites lets people contribute to a more diverse online world. This
                            idea opposes the restrictions and privacy problems often found on social media. However,
                            choosing between a personal website and social media depends on personal goals, likes, and
                            who the audience is.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This situation brings to mind I saw many users on social media complaining about
                            website-building platforms like Wix and Webflow. When users stop paying, these platforms
                            clear all the data from the websites they've created. While these platforms make it easy for
                            users to build their own websites, concerns about privacy and ownership arise.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Q2: In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites.
                            Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own
                            simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your Github server and post
                            the link here.</h4>
                        <p>
                            Imagine a website as a digital theme park, where every webpage resembles a unique ride or
                            attraction. The homepage acts as the park entrance, directing visitors to different sections
                            that represent diverse aspects of the site. Navigating through the website becomes a voyage
                            through themed lands, each featuring distinctive content and experiences. Similar to
                            visitors exploring various rides, users traverse through pages, uncovering information, and
                            engaging with interactive elements. The design of the website mirrors the layout of an
                            amusement park, providing an immersive and pleasurable experience for visitors.
